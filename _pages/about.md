Hello! I’m **Mingda Zhang**, an undergraduate at the School of Software, Yunnan University (Sep 2022–Jun 2026). I work on **vision–language models**, **multimodality**, **NLP**, and **computer vision**, aiming to tightly integrate language and visual signals for real-world applications in medical imaging and legal analysis. 

I’m fortunate to be mentored by **Professor [Jianglong Qin](http://www.sei.ynu.edu.cn/info/1023/1448.htm)** (Software, YNU), **Professor [Qing Xu](http://www.law.ynu.edu.cn/info/1143/3322.htm)** (Law, YNU), and **Professor [Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/)** (NUAA), whose guidance has helped me develop a systematic, problem-driven approach to AI research.

## Education
- **Yunnan University, School of Software — B.Eng.** (Sep 2022 – Jun 2026)
- **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)** (Oct 2025 – Apr 2026), Advisor: [**Xiaoying Tang**](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/faculty/tangxiaoying)

## Internships
- **China Telecom, Chongqing Branch** (Jul 2024 – Aug 2024)

## Research Highlights
======
###  Medical Image Analysis & Segmentation
- Author/co-author on lung disease recognition in collaboration with **Army Medical University (AMU)**.
- Dataset: **Privately processed dataset with institutional ethics approval** (IRB/ethics cleared; contains sensitive medical data and cannot be released publicly).  
  ➤ Access: available to qualified researchers under a data-use agreement and ethics compliance. *(Contact Me: yao110002@gmail.com)* 

###  Applications of Large Language Models
- Collaborated with the **President of an Intermediate People’s Court**; our system received multiple letters of recommendation.
- Sep 2025: **National Social Science Fund of China (NSSFC)** project officially approved —  
  *“An Empirical Study on the Mechanism of Judicial Justice in the Digital-Intelligence Era under Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.”*  

###  GitHub — 160★ Project
