Hello! I‚Äôm **Mingda Zhang**, an undergraduate at the School of Software, Yunnan University (Sep 2022‚ÄìJun 2026). I work on **vision‚Äìlanguage models**, **multimodality**, **NLP**, and **computer vision**, aiming to tightly integrate language and visual signals for real-world applications in medical imaging and legal analysis. 

I‚Äôm fortunate to be mentored by **Professor [Jianglong Qin](http://www.sei.ynu.edu.cn/info/1023/1448.htm)** (Software, YNU), **Professor [Qing Xu](http://www.law.ynu.edu.cn/info/1143/3322.htm)** (Law, YNU), and **Professor [Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/)** (NUAA), whose guidance has helped me develop a systematic, problem-driven approach to AI research.
